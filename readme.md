# """Spigot 1.17"""
Thanks for all the rages, but Spigot 1.17 is now officially available and can be obtained by using BuildTools!

See [this](https://github.com/nahkd123/spigot-1.17/issues/8) for more information.

---

Hello and welcome, this is Spigot 1.17, which is basically Spigot 1.16 but it's patched to make it work with 1.17

Actual build can be obtained by using official [BuildTools](https://ci.md-5.net/job/BungeeCord/)

## Build
To build this project, you need:
- JDK 16 (because Minecraft 1.17 now requires Java 16)
- Apache Maven

Simply clone this repository, ``cd spigot-1.17`` and then run ``mvn package``. This will compile and create the jar file

## Pre-built JAR
In case you don't want to build the jar by yourself, you can go to [Release](https://github.com/nahkd123/spigot-1.17/releases/)
tab and get one for yourself
